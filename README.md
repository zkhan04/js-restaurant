Didn't really try very hard to make this look nice or add content, just used it to learn webpack!

What I learned:
- How to test filetypes and use the appropriate loaders in webpack config files, such as pictures, fonts and json
- How to configure entry and output
- How to use a template file for dist/index.html
- How to create modules and export certain functions from them
- Development/production mode and how to use a common config file to reduce repeated code
